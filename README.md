## *TASKEREN EDITION*

This branch of Threepole is edited by Taskeren to provide extra features and bug fixes.\
However, I'm not good at Tauri, Svelte and Rust, which is the basement of this project. So if you find any problems, feel free to leave an issue. But I can't guarantee to fix it as I could have no idea about how to fix it.

Changes from the original version:
- Overlay timer for dungeons are now showing correctly (since v1.2.0)
- Activity name and its type is now showing at Main Window, instead of simply "NOT IN ACTIVITY". Supported types are Raids, Dungeons, Strikes and Lost Sectors. (since v1.2.0)

## About

Threepole is a clean, minimal Destiny 2 timer/tracker written in Rust and Svelte that displays stats about your current activity and clear history.

**If you want to use the overlay, make sure that you play Destiny 2 in borderless windowed or windowed fullscreen mode.**

## Features
- No sign-in required (your account needs to be public though)
- Non-overlay window for those who play in pure fullscreen mode
- Fast-updating and accurate API timer
- Displays your daily clear count
- Notifications displaying the results of your last clear
- Clean, unintrusive widget located above your minimap
- Easy-to-access configuration and account-switching
- Runs in the background and is manageable via the tray icon
- More features coming soon
